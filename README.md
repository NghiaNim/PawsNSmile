# PawsNSmile
Is life happening too quick in a pandemic? Does everyday feel the same and time slowly reveals itself to be a social construct made to run a functional society? Is Zoom too tiring and thoughts of how an online video costs you $50k in tuition is making you rethink your life decisions?

I can't fix any of those problems but here's some cute cats and dogs.

##Installation

Install Pillow and Flickrapi before running PawsNSmile

'''bash
pip install pillow
pip install flickrapi
'''bash

##Usage
Step 1: Run the [gui.py](gui.py) file and a functional window will pop up.
Step 2: Before indulging in your cats and dogs, remember to generate them. Every generation will create 50 cats or 50 dogs.
Step 3: View some samples to see if it is to your liking.
Step 4: Use a timer to set a certain interval that you want your cats and dogs to appear. They will disappear on their own after 3 seconds.
Step 5: Enjoy your cats and dogs while Zoom university destroy your soul.

##Customize your cats and dogs
Are the regular cats and dogs too tame for you?
Head into the [cat.py](cat.py) or [dog.py](dog.py) file to change it up. Use other keywords, other sorts, or other tags to spice up your gallerty
